# Updating the Name

To make sure everything plays nicely with your own code, replace all instances of the word "template" with your package name.

!!! Tip

    If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor, you can do ++ctrl+shift+H++ to find-and-replace all instances of "template" with your own package name.

!!! Note

    Don't forget to update the name of the [`src/template`](../../src/template) folder, e.g. so that it is of the form `src/<MyPackageName>`.
