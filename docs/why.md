# Why?

The first question to address is: why? Why use a template repository like this? Why make a Python package at all, as opposed to writing custom scripts or Jupyter Notebooks?

The answer, in short, is _sustainable and reproducible_ software development. Here are some of the benefits:

- Your package can be easily installed by others using `pip`
- Your package can have _automated_ unit tests that run every time you make a commit, making sure you don't break your own code.
- You can easily make documentation with no hassle.
- You will instantly be adopting good programming practices that will help you for life.

## Alternatives

This is by no means the only template of its kind. Some alternatives include:

- [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
- [cookiecutter-cms](https://github.com/MolSSI/cookiecutter-cms)
- [pyscaffold](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold)

... and many more.

Feel free to use them if you wish! This template repository exists because we are all opinionated people, and this template focuses on things that I value most. But the point is to just use something that works well for you.
